			<h1> Information </h1>
			<div class = "infoUser" id = "infoCont">
				<h2 id = "infoH" style = "display:none;"> Information For You </h2>

				<h4 id = "h0"> For People Aged Over 50 </h4>
				<p id = "p0" style = "display:none;"> Regular Check-Ups by your G.P and living a healthy lifestyle are needed. As one ages their chances of having a stroke increase substantially (above 50). There isn’t a solution to the fact we all age but one can do all they can to ensure they are not engaging in any risk factors and are getting frequent checkups from their G.P to evaluate their health and deal with any non-treatable risk factors/conditions as soon as possible.
				</p>

				<h4 id = "h1"> High Blood Pressure </h4>
				<p id = "p1" style = "display:none;"> Keep your blood pressure in check! High blood pressure (hypertension) is the most important known risk factor for stroke. High blood pressure can cause damage to blood vessel walls, which may eventually lead to a stroke. Thus one must lead a healthy lifestyle, aiming to keep their blood pressure as low as possible. (healthy diet, regular exercise).
				</p>

				<h4 id = "h2"> Diabetes </h4>
				<p id = "p2" style = "display:none;"> Keep your diabetes in check! if diabetes is left untreated or uncontrolled it increases the risk of vascular disease (disease of the blood vessels). This is when your artery walls become hard and narrow. This increases the risk of stroke, particularly ischaemic stroke. You are also more likely to have high blood pressure, another risk factor for strokes. Thus an individual with diabetes must keep on top of their treatment and constantly aim to improve their lifestyle and receive regular check- ups.
				</p>

				<h4 id = "h3"> Family History of Stroke and CVD</h4>
				<p id = "p3" style = "display:none;"> Get regular checkups! A  family history of CVD or strokes themselves are indeed a cause for concern but they can   be used to lead doctors to the behaviours you need to change in order to lower your risk. By getting a check-up and letting your doctor know about these facts they can perform further. 
				</p>

				<h4 id = "h4"> Irregular Heartbeat </h4>
				<p id = "p4" style = "display:none;"> Visit your G.P to discuss personal solutions. An irregular heartbeat can result in ‘sluggish’ bloodflow. This can result in blood clots which break loose and travel to the brain or other parts of the body. If a clot travels to the brain it can block an artery and cause a stroke. An individual suspected of or diagnosed with an irregular heartbeat should consult with their G.P as to what action can be taken to avoid the issue of poor blood flow, clotting and thus a stroke.
				</p>

				<h4 id = "h5"> Smoking</h4>
				<p id = "p5" style = "display:none;"> Find yourself a program and quit! Smoking increases blood pressure and reduces the amount of oxygen in the blood. Furthermore the extensive amounts of harmful chemicals damage artery walls, increasing chances of atherosclerosis (hardening and narrowing of arteries) and thus the chance of blood clots and thus a stroke!
				</p>

				<h4 id = "h6"> Poor Diet</h4>
				<p id = "p6" style = "display:none;"> Seek G.P or Dietician advice. An unhealthy diet simply raises your blood-pressure and cholesterol levels. When there is an excess of cholesterol in the artery walls, arteries can narrow or a complete blockage can occur in the artery. This disease in the arteries is known as atherosclerosis and it can cause a stroke.If you are struggling to maintain a healthy diet or if you aren’t sure if your current diet is sufficient it is recommended you visit a G.P or dietician to construct a diet plan specific to your weight, age and gender.
				</p>

				<h4 id = "h7"> Obesity</h4>
				<p id = "p7" style = "display:none;"> See your G.P and dietician to receive personalised plans for diet and exercise. An obese individual has higher blood-pressure, cholesterol levels and risks getting diabetes, each disease heavily impacts the health of the individuals arteries and thus their chances of having a stroke rapidly increase. An obese individual should regularly visit their G.P and dietician to ensure strict compliance to personalised requirements in order to live a healthy lifestyle and reduce the risk of having a stroke.
				</p>

				<h4 id = "h8"> Poor Exercise</h4>
				<p id = "p8" style = "display:none;"> See your G.P to develop an appropriate exercise routine. A lack of exercises results in rises in blood-pressure and cholesterol, and thus increases chances of diseases in the arteries (blockages or hardening) and thus a stroke. Every individual should aim to have a consistent exercise program structured for them by considering any limitations they may have.
				</p>

				<h4 id = "h9"> High Alcohol Consumption</h4>
				<p id = "p9" style = "display:none;"> Seek help from support groups and other legitimate organisations. Regular, heavy drinking can raise blood pressure and thus increases the risk of both types of stroke (ischaemic and haemorrhagic) due to the damage high-blood pressure does to artery walls and thus blood-flow throughout the body. An individual struggling with alcoholism should seek help through support groups or other organisations.

		<h2> What is stroke? </h2>
		<p> Strokes occur due to a blockage of blood flow to the brain. It’s a disease that effects the arteries leading to and within the brain itself.<br> <br>
		    A blood vessel that normally carries oxygen and nutrients to the brain becomes either blocked, clotted or bursts and thus when the brain is deprived of such necessary sustenance, the cells and correlating parts of the body are drastically effected.
		    All strokes happen in the brain, but there are different types with different causes that require specialised treatment. </p>

		<p> Three main types of Strokes: </p>
		    <li> Ischemic:
			<p> Transient Ischemic Attack, known commonly as mini strokes. The brain is only cut off from blood for short amounts of time. Often interpreted as a warning sign. 

		    <li> Haemorrhagic: 
			<p> Caused by arteries in the brain either leaking blood or bursting open. The leaked blood puts pressure on the brain cells and damages them.
			<br> Often caused by conditions such as hypertension trauma (High blood pressure), blood thinning medications and aneurysms (A weak spot in the wall of an artery that often bursts!).

		    <li> TIA:
			<p> Transient Ischemic Attack, known commonly as mini strokes. The brain is only cut off from blood for short amounts of time.
			<br> Often interpreted as a warning sign. </p>
			<p> The person will experience both emotional and physical issues dependent on the severity and location of the stroke. Some after effects include trouble with: <p>
				<ul style="list-style-type:square">
					<li> Seeing
					<li> Sleeping
					<li> Loss of control of bladder or bowels
					<li> Loss of movement of certain body parts
					<li> Fatigue
					<li> Pain
					<li> Trouble thinking
					<li> Loss of memory
					<li> Depression
				</ul>

		
		<br>	
		<h2> Signs and Symptoms: </h2>
			<ul style="list-style-type:square">
				<li> Numbness/weakness in the face, arm or leg (Especially if on one particular side of the body)
				<li> Confusion, trouble speaking or trouble understanding others.
				<li> Trouble seeing in one or both eyes
				<li> Trouble walking, dizziness, loss of balance and general co-ordination.
				<li> Severe headache with no cause
				
			</ul>
		
		<br>
		<h2> Signs and Symptoms: </h2>
		<p> It is vital that if you notice any of these sudden onset symptoms that you are firstly, able to recognise them. Secondly, that you immediately dial 000.</p>
			
		<p> Also note that if your symptoms go away soon after that it is most likely a TIA and you should still seek immediate medical attention! </p>

		<h2> Treatment and Prevention: </h2>	
		<p> Many of the effects of a stroke are permanent or require rehabilitation, the best way to “treat” a stroke is with prevention.
		<br> If you have had a stroke or engage in risk factors, you are at a greater risk of having one. </p>
