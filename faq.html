		<h3> What is Prevent-A-Stroke? </h3>
		<p> We are a non-profit organisation aimed at promoting prevention over treatment and a nation-wide acknowledgement of Strokes and there causes.<p/>

		<h3> How are you going to help me? </h3>
		<p> As well as providing a simple overview of what a stroke is, and how you can prevent it, our online calculator assesses your risks, and with login, we personalise information for you so you can take action and avoid a stroke! <br> Furthermore, our up to date newsfeed provides links to the most recent developments in research, including prevention, causes and treatments.<p/>

		<h3> Why should I log in? </h3>

		    This means whenever you take the test again you can acknowledge changes you have made and watch your risk go down and feel better all at once. <p/>
